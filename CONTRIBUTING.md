## Code of Conduct

```

Adding this file will make collaboration smoother and more professional‚Äîespecially as your series grows and more folks start following along.

## Commit Message Style

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec.
Your commit messages should look like:

```
<type>(<scope>?): <description>

<body>?
<footer>?
```

Where **type** is one of:
- **feat**: a new feature
- **fix**: a bug fix
- **docs**: documentation only changes
- **style**: formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change
- **refactor**: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: code change that improves performance
- **test**: adding missing tests or correcting existing ones
- **chore**: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Example:**
```
feat(lab01): add disclaimer to README about synthetic data
fix(lab02): correct typo in starter prompt
docs(contributing): add Conventional Commit guidelines
```
```

That's all you need‚Äîno CI or enforcement required up front, but it sets clear expectations for anyone contributing.
